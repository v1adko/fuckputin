# Javelin 🚀

🇺🇦 A DDoS helper tool to bring down enemy websites - based on [bombardier](https://github.com/codesenberg/bombardier) for long-term unsupervised execution 🇺🇦  

## Update

It used to be a viable option, but now there's a better tool [oficially endorsed by IT Army of Ukraine](https://t.me/itarmyofukraine2022/229).  

Please star the repo for the [db1000n](https://github.com/Arriven/db1000n) project and follow the setup instructions:
- [English](https://telegra.ph/Death-by-1000-needles-03-18)
- [Українська](https://telegra.ph/Death-by-1000-needles-03-17)

The core idea of the project is the same as javelin - load generation with syncronised target coordination, but with a much better architecture and technical team.

The target list within this repo will not be updated anymore as now this coordination is done by oficial channels and it will result in a much more effective attacks.
